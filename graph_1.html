                This geospatial map reveals average purchase values for U.S. states, with each layer differing in that it represents a different product category. Blacker colors indicate greater average spend within the category, allowing users to examine local patterns of Clothing, Accessories, and more. A layer control panel allows direct comparison across categories, raising interactivity and making detailed analysis easier.

                Alaska stands alone as the sole state with the highest average purchase value overall, while most states fall in middle to low-spending ranks. The tooltip for a state provides additional information, including average purchase value, customer ratings, best product category, promo code redemption, and subscription purchase levels. Although "Clothing" is the top category for most states, New Mexico and West Virginia favor "Accessories" individually, suggesting varying regional preferences or market forces.

                These patterns may suggest broader distinctions in economic conditions, consumer shopping, and success at the point of marketing among states. Stacked style highlights not only where it's high or low expenditure, but also on what consumers are spendingâ€”giving better category-level insights into patterns within the U.S. marketplace.
