            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
            <p> 
                This bar chart illustrates purchase trends across four product categories—Accessories, Clothing, Footwear, and Outerwear—by gender. Interestingly, males consistently make more purchases than females in all categories. Clothing emerges as the most popular category for both genders, with males making more than twice as many purchases as females. Accessories follow, again with males leading significantly, while Footwear and Outerwear show lower overall volumes but maintain the same gender pattern. The visualization also allows the user to filter by state and see the differences in gender in any state they chose.

                These findings challenge common societal stereotypes that suggest females shop more frequently or have a stronger interest in fashion and retail consumption. In contrast, this data shows males not only making more purchases overall but also showing strong category preferences, particularly for clothing and accessories. Meanwhile, female purchasing behavior appears more balanced across categories.
