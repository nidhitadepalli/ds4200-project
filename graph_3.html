            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
            <p> 
                This bar chart illustrates purchase trends across four product categories—Accessories, Clothing, Footwear, and Outerwear—by gender and season. Males consistently make more purchases than females in all categories year-round, with clothing being the most popular and outerwear the least. Male clothing purchases peak in Spring, while overall category preferences remain relatively stable across seasons. The data highlights that males not only shop more frequently but also display stronger preferences for specific categories, particularly clothing, whereas females show a more balanced distribution of purchases across categories.
