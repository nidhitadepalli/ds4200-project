            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
            <p> 
                The Tableau line chart "Distribution of Purchase Frequency Across Seasons" reveals distinct seasonal purchasing patterns. Weekly (purple) purchasing shows steady decline from Winter to Summer, dropping to its lowest in Summer after surging to the highest point in Winter. Bi-weekly (light purple) demonstrates the opposite trend, peaking in Spring at approximately 155 customers before steadily declining to about 120 customers by Fall. Quarterly (light brown) customers increase steadily from Winter through Summer (peaking around 144) before declining ever so slightly in Fall. Fortnightly (light pink) displays a steady decline from Winter through Summer, its lowest point being Summer at around 127 customers, before spiking back up during Fall. Monthly (dark brown) mainly follows suit with Weekly customers. Every 3 Months (dark pink) and Annual (dark purple) frequencies show more modest fluctuations across seasons. These contrasting patterns suggest customers shift their purchasing frequencies seasonally, with potential opportunities for targeted marketing strategies during transitional periods.
