                Our project uncovers a number of underlying patterns in consumer shopping habits within the series of seasonal, demographic, and geographic visualizations. We found that shopping is high in Spring and low in Summer, especially among frequent shoppers. Patterns in gender and in payments were uncovered, with differences in how consumer segments go about shopping. Patterns in geographic data offered another layer and uncovered that location too affects the shopping habits. All visualizations offer insight into where the different factors intersect. Our project can be expanded upon in the future to look at the product-level data or to compare several years of trends together. Adding interactive variables such as age or location would allow the findings to be made personal and actionable to business users.
