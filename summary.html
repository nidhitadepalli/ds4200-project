                Our project uncovers a number of underlying patterns in consumer shopping habits through a series of seasonal, demographic, and geographic visualizations. We found that shopping is high in Spring and low in Summer, especially among frequent shoppers. Gender patterns were exposed, highlighting differences in consumer segments' shopping behaviors. Male consumers had a much higher number of purchases across all categories compared to female consumers. Geographic data patterns revealed that shoppers across the country spent an average of 50-60 dollars and the most popular shopping category is clothing. Consumer payment types also indicate the frequency of purchases. Customers that prefer electronic payment methods tend to purchase more frequently than those who prefer cash.

                All the visualizations give insight into where the different factors intersect. The line graph effectively shows trends in buying frequency by seasons, while the grouped bar graph is simple to compare product choices by male and female buyers. The Sankey diagram shows the different payment options together with payment frequencies, and this provides richer insights into the behavior of consumers. These findings not only uncover unique behavioral patterns but also guide key business strategy. With insight into when and how different segments shop, companies can better plan inventory, tailor marketing, and optimize payment options. At the same time, there are opportunities here to drive a better customer experienceâ€”personalized offers, location-based promotions, and payment convenience can all be informed by these learnings. Our project can be expanded upon in the future to look at product-level data or to compare several years of trends together. By collecting more data and adding interactive variables such as age or location, the findings can become more personal and actionable to business users.
