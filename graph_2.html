            <h2>Analysis:</h2>
            <p> 
                The Sankey diagram visualizes the relationship between payment methods and customer payment frequency segments, illustrating how different payment methods correspond to various payment schedules. Credit Card users along with PayPal customers predominantly make "Weekly" payments. Cash payments show a strong connection to "Monthly" payments, as indicated by the label "Cash â†’ Monthly: 85 customers", but also have notable flows toward "Bi-Weekly" payments. Venmo users primarily opt for "Annual" payments, whereas Bank Transfer customers are split between "Fortnightly" and "Every 3 Months" schedules. The width of each flow represents the volume of customers for each payment method and frequency combination. This visualization provides valuable insights into customer payment preferences, helping businesses optimize payment systems and optimize cash flow
