            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Our project is focused on analyzing shopping trends and examining consumer behavior. 
                By analyzing these trends, businesses can tweak their marketing strategies as well as manage their inventory levels. 
                Since online shopping is on the rise, analyzing shopping data can provide useful insights into the behavior of different 
                demographics and how they interact with product categories. Analyzing these trends and observing the patterns can also allow 
                the consumer to receive more personalized recommendations. 
            </p>

                Introduction to the Data
            </h2>
            <p>
                The dataset that we chose for this project is about shopping trends. It consists of consumer transaction records, 
                including the product category, purchase amount in USD, payment method, and customer demographics like age and gender. 
                The dataset is a CSV file and it was downloaded from Kaggle. The entire dataset consists of 19 different categories and roughly 
                3000 observations. It has both categorical and continuous variables.
