              The concept for our fifth visualization will be to produce a heatmap showing the average purchase dollar amount (USD) per category and age range. Using the Age and Category columns in the data set, the visualization will highlight where spending varies between categories and between ages. The age data can be binned (i.e., 15–24, 25–34, etc.), and categories can be derived from the Category column in the data set. The average Purchase Amount USD value per category-age pair will be in each cell in the visualization, and relative spending will be conveyed through color intensity. A visualization such as this would easily and clearly communicate in a readable way where customer segments were spending the most money on what categories and would be a great window to consumer tastes. Features allowing higher levels of interaction with the visualization, such as viewing tooltips with exact values or gender filters, would be useful to allow. As none of the visualizations currently perform spending behavior between categories and ages, a new piece to the overall analysis would be provided by such the heatmap visualization.
